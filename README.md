TinyChat full screen video chat for WordPress/BuddyPress, 
This advanced version allows you to add your own room name.

== Installation ==

This will automatically create the page and install the short code with link *domain name/chatroom-advanced*, If it does not then please read the rest below.

Simply use shortcode [rnd_tinychat_page] in a page.

This also uses my modified Tinychat embed file, This get's updated externally so you'll never need to update it,

If you want to use Tinychats original then you'll have to change the embed file url to http://tinychat.com/embed/chat.js.

to your themes functions.php file.

* This is how it displays with both YouTube and Soundcloud.

== Notes ==

This is full screen video chat that is used on TinyChat,
This will allow you to input your own room name unlike my other version which has a set room name,
You can also add your autoop and prohash codes in to this when you're logged in to tinychat to show your pro icon and star,
If anyone else requires another feature or has an idea for me to implement, Then open a support ticket with the relevant information.
